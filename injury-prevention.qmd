## Flipped classrom approach
1- 10-15 min digital lecture + assignment  
2- in class - key points + group discussions related to injury prevention strategies  
3- out class - example session made by and for the cadets

# Welcome to this module

- Outline:
    - Who I am?
    - Purpose of this module
    - Our expectations to you
    - How the working module is organized
    - From the virtual to the redidental part
    



## How do you avoid getting injuried during service?

Start the lecture with a question or case.

- What is your strategy(ies) to prevent getting injured while in the military service? 

  - Use two minutes to discuss with your fellow cadet



## Overview of lecture

1\. Acute vs. overuse injuries  
2\. Which strategies do we have?  
3\. Warm-up as a strategy  
4\. Warm-up mechanisms  
5\. Warm-up in sport to prevent injuries  
6\. For the throwing athlete / soldier  
7\. Warm up to improve performance  
8\. Take home and assignment  
  - Your school-team will execute this warm-up program during the residential stay

## Injures in the armed forces

- Training-related injuries 
  - Injuries results in five to 22 times more days of limited duty than illnesses [@knapik_2004]

- Physical training is a primary cause and risk factor for musculoskeletal injuries [@wardle_2017]

::: {.notes}

- yet developing and maintaining physical capability is a critical aspect of military training and employment

- acquiring and maintaining a high level of physical fitness (endurance, strength), is necessary for successful perofrmance of military-specific tasks during training and operations

- mitigation strategies for MSKI therefore include, but are not limited to, optimising PT and injury prevention

- but first, let us look into what is an injury

:::



## Injuries {.smaller}

::: {.panel-tabset}

### Acute injures

- An acute injury is a sudden injury that occurs at a specific, identifiable moment, usually with a clear and defined cause

- It results directly from tissue damage when the affected tissue is unable to withstand the load or force applied to it

Table from @wardle_2017 review

::: {.notes}

- knowledge of physical fitness, supervision of injury prevention strategies are important for prevention for injury
- important for making an appropriate training plan that accounts for soldiers multifactorial stress components, that may lead to overtraining and risk for muscloskeletal injuries.

reducing physical training volume in the initial military training may benefit the soldier. A progressive load on soldiers body, may reduce development of overuse injuries.

[@mcgowan_2015]

::: {.notes}

- Theory: an increase in muscle temperature of $\text{1 }^{\circ}\text{C}$ can enhance subsequent exercise performance by 2-5% [@racinais_2010].

In zochowski 2007
- Enhanced performance has been associated with vasodilation of muscle blood vessels and the associated rightward shorth og hte oxyhemoglobin-dissociation curve after warm-up.
- Hemoglobin gives up almost twice as much oxygen at $\text{41 }^{\circ}\text{C}$ as at $\text{36 }^{\circ}\text{C}$, and oxygen dissociates twice as rapidly.
- Improves central-nervous-system function (p 202)
- Warm-up can allow subsequent tasks to begin with an elevated baseline $\text{VO}_{2}$. Resulting in less of the initial work is completed anaerobically.

## Armed forces injury prevention
### Warm-up strategies

- Dynamic warm up should include agility, plyometrics, power, cora and balance
- These components enhance muscle flexibility, joint mobility, and neuromuscular activation, which is essential for optimal injury prevention


::: {.notes}

- Has a substantial impact of the readiness of the force
- Due to the amount of limited duty time they cause



:::


## Implementation of warm-up i sports {.smaller}
### Movements

- Rapid movement exercises

- Six different sets of exercise (fotbal)  
1\ slow runing with moveemnts  
2\ strength - plyometrics and balance (10 min)  
3\ speed running specific to football (sudden changes/direction)  


Outcome:

Lower risk of injuries overall, overuse injures and severe injuries in the intervention group

*Can reduce the risk of injury with 50% *

[@soligard_2008;@kirkendall_2010]


::: {.notes}

- plank, side plank, nordic hamstring, single leg balance
- jumping exercise
- fast runing exercises

## Warm-up

- General warm-up
- Specific warm-up

- Stretching

- For subsequent training exercises

- Transition phase (15 min sprint performance)
 
**[injury prevetnion vs. performance enhancing effect]**




# Warm-up For Injury and Performance Enhancement

## Warm-up
### Active warm up


- Warm-up for subsequent exercise performance 

- Elevation of oxygen uptake kinetics
  - Baseline VO_2 may be elevated in response the priming exercise
  - Transition phase should not exceed 10 min
  - May lead to an initial sparing of persons anaerobic stores, preserving this energy for subsequent use


## Passive Warm-Up


 
## Implementation of warm-up i sports
### The throwing athlete - movement demand

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50"}

- Having a greater flexibility in external rotation can benefit the throwing performance

- However, excessive stretching can exacerbate capsule laxity and lead to shoulder instability

 - Stretching together with repetitive throwing motions with extreme external rotation can lead to capsular instability and injury (labrum and rotator cuff muscles)

**How can we circumvent this throwing paradox?**

- Increasing the range of motion elsewhere in the chain?

- Increasing thoracic spine mobility in extension and rotation
- Eliminates the excessive glenohumeral external rotation range of motion
- Which avoids stress on the anterior capsule laxitiy and stress on bicpes brachii tendon (long head)

How does a proper warm-up session look like for an throwing athlete

- Prevent pain and injury

- Program should encompass
    - thoracic spoine mobility exercises 
    - facilitate shoulder stabilizers trapezius, rotator cuff muscles, scapula stabilizers (m. trapezius)
    - warm-up reduces risk on injury in all phases of a throw

6 males (mean age 25) 
Cross-over design - separated by 14 days.

6 sec maximal sprint on a cycle ergometer

First meeting
- Pre warmed thigh muscles in bath ($\text{42.8}^{\circ}\text{C}$) for 30 min.

Second meeting
- normal condition

::: {.fragment .custom .blur}
Results:
Pre warmed to $\text{37.5}^{\circ}\text{C}$ vs. normal condition $\text{34}^{\circ}\text{C}$

Mean power output during the sprint was greater in the pre warm group compared to the normal condition group

Probably due to the elevated temperature improves cross-bridge cycling between actin and myosin proteins in the muscle cell.

## Warm-up for performance {.smaller}
### Swimming

- Pooled based warm-ups vs. dry-land-based warm-ups
    - Performance? 
    
- Active vs. no warm-up  
    - Faster [] and similar [] performance after 1000 m pooled-based

- Race-pace effort during warm-up (prime swimmers)
    - Faster 50m split times []

    
## Warm-up for performance {.smaller}
### Swimming

- Transition phase
    - Often long time between active warm-up and competition (often >20 min)
    
- Shorter transition phase (10vs. 45 min) is associated with better performance (200m) [@zochowski_2007]

    - Maintain elevated core temperature
    
- What to to?
    - Should complete between 500 - 1200 m
    - Include a short race pace efforts towards the end of of their pool warm-up


::: {.notes}

1. Coaches believe that this is superior as it is gaining a feel for the water

2. However, this is not the case. Both methods can enhance swimming performance

3. 

4. Dry-land activities can be a nice alternative to maintain elevated body core temperature

## Take home for injury prevention

- Education of military leaders:
  - Training load and intensity planing (total training load)  
  - Resistance training  

- Warm-up strategies
    - Injury
    - Improve performance
    
- Mobility exercises?
    
  
::: {.notes}

Start with a case, problem,  
Set the stage  
And ask how would the students think of this in the light of this lecture, 
alternative, illustrate how experts in this field would think about it
